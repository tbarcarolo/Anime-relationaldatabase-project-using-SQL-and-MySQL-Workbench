# Anime relational database project using SQL and MySQL Workbench

In this project, I created a relational database from scratch using a dataset about anime shows.

The goal was to practice and demonstrate my skills in database modeling, SQL, and data structuring. 

I built several related tables such as anime, studios, ranking, genres, and a junction table anime_genres, applying primary and foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity. The database was populated with real data from a CSV file. I wrote all SQL code manually and only after completing the structure and content did I generate the Entity-Relationship diagram through reverse engineering using MySQL Workbench. 

The result is a clean, normalized, and well-connected database structure that allows for meaningful queries and potential analysis, making it suitable for both practice and demonstration purposes.


Tools used in this project:

MySQL — Database management system used to create and manage the entire project.
SQL — Language used for defining the schema, inserting data, and running queries.
MySQL Workbench — Used as the main development environment and to generate the ER diagram through reverse engineering.
CSV Dataset (data_anime.csv) — Source of the data used to populate the database.
